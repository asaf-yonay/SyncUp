# SyncUp Memory Bank

This directory contains the project's memory bank, which serves as a comprehensive knowledge base for the SyncUp project. The memory bank is organized into several key components:

## Core Files

- `projectbrief.md`: Project overview and requirements
- `productContext.md`: Product flows and user experience
- `systemPatterns.md`: Architecture and design patterns
- `techContext.md`: Technical stack and development setup
- `activeContext.md`: Current focus and recent changes
- `progress.md`: Project status and known issues

## Additional Context

- `database/`: Database schema and relationships
- `voice-commands/`: Voice command patterns and implementation
- `sql/`: SQL examples and queries

## Usage

Each file in the memory bank should be updated regularly to reflect the current state of the project. The structure is designed to provide quick access to important information and maintain consistency across the development team.

## Maintenance

- Update files when significant changes occur
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- Use clear, concise language
- Include relevant code examples where appropriate
